Overview
--------

FP2P (FPGA Port To Pin) is a tool for robust port to pin assignment in multi-board FPGA designs.
The implementation has two main goals, safety (check as many potential human mistakes as possible) and reusability (reuse connections mappings, defined in files, in multiple designs).
It is fully declarative and programming language-agnostic from the users perspective.
